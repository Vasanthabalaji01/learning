script that prompts the user for a folder path and performs spell-checking on every file within that folder using the `aspell` command-line tool in Ubuntu:

To use this script:

1. Save the script to a file (e.g., `CheckSpelling.sh`).
2. Make the script executable by running `chmod +x CheckSpelling.sh`.
3. Run the script with `./CheckSpelling.sh`.

The script will prompt you to enter the folder path. Provide the absolute or relative path to the folder you want to spell-check. The script will iterate through each file in that folder (excluding subfolders) and perform spell-checking using the `aspell` tool with the English language (`--lang=en`). The script will display the file name and the spell-checking results using the `aspell` command's `--check` option.

You can adjust the language or modify the script further according to your specific requirements or preferences.
