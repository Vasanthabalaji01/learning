Automates the steps to set up a LAMP server on your local Ubuntu machine:

To use this script:

1. Save the script to a file (e.g., `lamp_setup.sh`).
2. Make the script executable by running `chmod +x lamp_setup.sh`.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script with `./lamp_setup.sh`.

During the MySQL installation, you'll be prompted to set a root password. Replace `'your_password'` in the script with the password you set during the MySQL installation.

The script will then automatically install Apache, MySQL, PHP, configure Apache to use the `public` directory as the web root, enable the Apache rewrite module, and configure MySQL with the provided root password.

After running the script, you'll have a fully set up LAMP server on your local Ubuntu machine. You can place your web files inside the `/var/www/html` directory and access them through a web browser.
