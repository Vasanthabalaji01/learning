<h1>Cloud Resource Monitoring and Alerting</h1> 
Write a Bash script that monitors the performance, availability, and health of various cloud resources like virtual machines, databases, or containers. The script can collect metrics, check logs, and send alerts or notifications when anomalies or predefined thresholds are detected.<br>

<details>
<summary><h4>In this Shell script</h4></summary>
<br>

- Set the required configuration variables such as the AWS region, instance ID, and CPU threshold according to your specific environment.

- The aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics command retrieves the CPU utilization metric for the specified EC2 instance using CloudWatch. Adjust the command as necessary for your cloud provider and their respective monitoring tools.

- The script compares the CPU utilization against the predefined threshold using the bc command. If the utilization exceeds the threshold, the send_alert function is called to send an alert or notification. Replace the send_alert function with your desired alert/notification mechanism.

- The script sleeps for a specified interval (in this case, 60 seconds) before checking the CPU utilization again. Adjust the sleep duration as needed based on your monitoring requirements.

     - To install and configure the necessary command-line tools or SDKs for your chosen cloud provider. Additionally, modify the script to monitor other resource metrics (e.g., memory usage, network traffic) or different types of cloud resources (e.g., databases, containers) based on the available monitoring capabilities provided by your cloud provider.

<h1>Automated Scaling and Load Balancing</h1> 
Build a Bash script that dynamically scales cloud resources based on demand and distributes traffic across multiple instances using load balancers. The script can monitor resource utilization, adjust the number of instances, and update load balancing configurations accordingly.<br>

<details>
<summary><h4>In this Shell script</h4></summary>
<br>

- The scale_instances function retrieves the current number of running instances and the CPU utilization of each instance.

- If the CPU utilization exceeds the threshold, the script checks if the current instance count is less than the maximum allowed instances. If it is, a new instance is launched using the aws ec2 run-instances command.

- If the CPU utilization falls below the threshold, the script checks if the current instance count is greater than the minimum allowed instances. If it is, a healthy instance is selected from the target group associated with the load balancer using the aws elbv2 describe-target-health command, and that instance is terminated using the aws ec2 terminate-instances command.

- After scaling the instances, the load balancer configuration is updated to set a deregistration delay of 30 seconds using the aws elbv2 modify-target-group-attributes command.

- The current number of instances after scaling is printed for monitoring purposes.

     - need to replace the placeholder values (e.g., APP_NAME, LOAD_BALANCER_NAME) with the actual names or ARNs of your resources. Additionally, adjust the AWS CLI commands based on your cloud provider's specific APIs or command-line tools.

<h1>Log Aggregation and Analysis</h1> 
Develop a Bash script that aggregates logs from various cloud services or applications into a central location for analysis and troubleshooting. The script can fetch logs from multiple sources, apply filtering or parsing, and provide actionable insights or generate reports.<br>

<details>
<summary><h4>In this Shell script</h4></summary>
<br>

- Set the LOG_SOURCES array to include the sources and their corresponding log directories. Each entry in the array should follow the format source:/path/to/logs_directory.

- Set the LOG_DESTINATION variable to specify the central location where the logs will be copied to.

- The fetch_logs function takes a source, logs directory, and destination as arguments. It uses the rsync command to fetch logs from the source to a temporary directory and then copies them to the central location. The --delete option ensures that any logs deleted from the source are also removed from the destination, and the --remove-source-files option removes the copied logs from the source.

- The script iterates through each log source defined in LOG_SOURCES, extracts the source and logs directory, and calls the fetch_logs function to fetch and copy the logs to the central location.

- After copying the logs, you can perform additional log processing or analysis. This section can be customized based on your specific requirements. You can use tools like grep, awk, sed, or custom scripts to filter, parse, generate reports, or perform any other analysis on the logs.

- The script prints a completion message to indicate that the log aggregation process has completed.

     - customize this script further to suit your specific log sources, log destinations, and any additional log processing or analysis requirements.
